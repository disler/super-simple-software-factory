# Observability Reference

The event schema, the seven SQLite tables, and the polling contract — the one data path is **selected harness adapters → sqlite → web ui**.

## Two stores, one truth

**Files are the raw record** (`raw_output.jsonl` streams, `envelope.json`, `agent_map.json`); **SQLite (`sssf.db`) is the queryable mirror** the UI reads. `tracer.py` writes both. Losing the db loses nothing that can't be rebuilt from files.

Location comes from `observability.db` in `sssf.config.yaml`, default `adws/adw_data/sssf.db` — inside the **target** repo, gitignored.

## Event schema

`tracer.py` emits these types, every one logged against its `adw_id` **and** `phase_id`:

| Type | Emitted when |
|---|---|
| `phase_start` | a `run.phase(...)` block is entered |
| `agent_start` | a coding agent is spawned or resumed for `ph.call(...)` |
| `tool_call` | a tool (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`) returns — **one event per real call**, named `bash: ls -la src`, payload `{tool, tool_call_id, args, result_snippet, ok, duration_ms, agent}` |
| `handoff` | an envelope crosses from one agent to the next |
| `gate_pass` | a gate found no failed checks — payload carries `attempt`, `checks` (the evidence), and an empty `violations` |
| `gate_fail` | a gate found at least one failed check — payload carries `attempt`, `checks`, and `violations` |
| `log` | an explicit `ph.log(...)` from the ADW script |
| `agent_end` | the agent's run completes; envelope parsed or not — payload carries `cost`, `usage` (the per-component breakdown), `context_tokens`, `context_window` |
| `phase_end` | the block exits; carries the resolved status |
| `error` | a raise inside a phase block |

`parent_id` nests spans, so an agent phase expands into its tool-call spans in the UI.

**Spend is itemised per phase.** `agent_end.usage` carries the normalized tokens and cost components emitted by the selected adapter, summed across every send the phase made, so a phase that retried on a bad envelope or a failed gate shows what all its attempts cost, not just the last one. Availability varies with the harness event protocol; the visualizer preserves the normalized values without inventing missing fields.

`reasoning_tokens` is the thinking share and is **inside** `output_tokens`, not a fifth component — measured across every session on disk, reasoning never exceeds output and the four components always reconcile to the total. It bills at the output rate, so the panel nests it under output rather than adding it. Runs predating the breakdown have no `usage` key at all; the lump `cost` and the event's own `tokens` still stand, and the UI says so rather than rendering zeroes.

**Context is occupancy, not spend.** `events.tokens` and `sessions.total_tokens` bill every turn, so they only grow — an agent that burned 100k tokens may be sitting in a 15k window. `context_tokens` is how full the window actually was when the agent stopped, which is what the visualizer's per-lane Context bar measures against `context_window`.

Pi computes its context fields from the last valid assistant turn and its installed model catalog. Claude Code reports context only from a verified final result with one `modelUsage` entry: `context_tokens = inputTokens + outputTokens + cacheReadInputTokens + cacheCreationInputTokens`, and `context_window = modelUsage.*.contextWindow`. Other adapters report context only when their stream exposes it. Missing context values remain NULL, and the lane draws no bar rather than a misleading empty one.

For Pi, an auto-compaction at the final act of a run can leave the recorded value pre-compaction; the tracer keeps the reported value rather than guessing.

**Gates record evidence, not just a verdict.** A gate returns one `{item, ok, note}` check per thing it looked at, and `violations` are derived from the failed ones. Both land in `gate_results` (`checks_json` + `violations_json`) and in the `gate_pass`/`gate_fail` payload, so a green gate can answer *what did you verify* — `{"item": "…/plan.md", "ok": true, "note": "exists, 454B"}` — rather than only *did it pass*. Rows written before this existed have `checks_json` NULL; treat that as "no evidence recorded", not "nothing checked".

The gate event payload carries `attempt` too, so the `gate_results` table and the event stream are equivalent sources — a live consumer can group gate results per correction round from events alone, without a second query.

**A `tool_call` is the one event that spans time**, so it fills both `started_at` and `ended_at` on the row — the tool's real start and return. Every other type is a point in time: `started_at` is when it was recorded and `ended_at` stays NULL. Lay tool calls out on a time axis from those columns, never by parsing `payload_json` (`duration_ms` is in the payload too, as pi's own number, but it is a convenience, not the source for layout).

**Streaming is solved by construction.** Each adapter parses its selected CLI's JSONL stream and the tracer inserts normalized events into `sssf.db` **while the agent is still working** — never batched at phase end. Everything downstream is a poll → render.

```

**A hung agent emits nothing**, which is exactly when you need its pid: no events, no tokens, no output to read. `processes` is the only table that can answer "what is this run running, and how do I stop it" — `just procs <adw_id>` lists what is live, `just kill <adw_id>` stops children before the parent, and both verify the recorded `command` still matches the pid before signalling it. A killed run finalizes its own trace: SIGTERM and SIGINT are turned into `SystemExit` in `session.ensure`, so the session lands on `fail` with its process rows closed instead of reading `running` forever.

**Derived, never stored:** phase durations (`ended_at − started_at`), session phase-progress (query `phases` by `adw_id`), lane layout (`kind` + `owner`).

Phase status invariants: `queued` only for manifest-declared phases not yet entered (dashed in the UI); `running` on enter; only a clean exit writes `success` — agent phases additionally need the envelope parsed and gates green; everything else resolves to `fail`.

## WAL pragmas

Open **every** connection — writer and reader — with:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000;
```

WAL allows readers during writes. Writers are the tracers of running ADW processes; concurrent writers are fine given one small transaction per event plus `busy_timeout`. The visualizer reads on a readonly connection with exactly one exception: archiving a session (`POST /api/sessions/:adw_id/archive`) opens a second connection to set `sessions.archived`. That flag is review triage — it says a human has looked at the run — so it is the reader's state living on the row, and no tracer ever writes or reads it.

## Polling contract

**The UI never receives pushes.** No ingest endpoint, no WebSocket, no backfill or dedup logic.

Live view polls on a rowid cursor every `observability.poll_ms` (default 500):

```sql
SELECT ... FROM events WHERE adw_id = ? AND rowid > ? ORDER BY rowid LIMIT 500;
```

Keep the highest `rowid` returned as the next cursor. History is **the same queries** with filters, lazy-paged as the engineer scrolls or drills in — one mechanism serves both live and past runs, which is why there is no separate replay path.
